## Internal Structure

The main entry point of Commy is the #[create_writer()] macro.  This attribute macro is applied to a struct and creates a new struct by the same name that can be used to write to a Commy file.

The new struct generated by the macro contains a Fields struct, the WriterID of the current instance of .  The macro encapsulates each field from the original struct in a FieldHolder struct field inside the Fields struct.  The FieldHolder struct contains the field, and a WriterID associated with each field.  The WriterID is used to identify which writer instance last updated the field.
