# Commy: Distributed Service Mesh Roadmap

## üéØ Vision Statement

Transform Commy from a simple IPC library into **THE premier distributed service mesh** that intelligently optimizes communication transport - using ultra-fast shared memory when services are co-located and seamlessly falling back to encrypted network communication when distributed. This creates a universal communication platform with consistent APIs across all major programming languages.

## üöÄ Core Value Propositions

- **Transparent Performance Optimization**: Automatic shared memory when local, network when distributed
- **Universal Language Support**: Native SDKs for Rust, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, C, C++, PHP
- **Integrated Security**: Built-in authentication, authorization, and encryption
- **Mesh-Native Configuration**: Distributed configuration management across entire mesh
- **Enterprise-Grade**: Production-ready with monitoring, compliance, and deployment tooling
